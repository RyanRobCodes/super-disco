# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code
This work day scheduler was built on the work of github user "Super-Disco"
It incorporates the JQuery, Bootstrap, and Moment APIs
This scheduler contains the current date and allows the user to input data 
into the text box and saves the data to local storage so when the user 
refreshes the page, the text stays in the field.
